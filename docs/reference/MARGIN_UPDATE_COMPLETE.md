## 📝 Files Updated

## ⚠️ Note on Low-Value Devices

For phones with wholesale value under $150 (iPhone 11 and older), the margins may be too thin. Consider:

1. **Option A:** Set minimum device value at $150
2. **Option B:** Charge $5 shipping for devices under $200
3. **Option C:** Don't accept devices older than iPhone 12

### Example Monthly Volume (100 trades):
- Average device value: $600 (iPhone 15/16)
- Average profit per device: $100 (after shipping)

### Competitive Position:
Even with reduced quotes, you're still competitive:
- **Gazelle iPhone 16 Pro Max:** ~$750
