# Test Summary - Solana Buyback Platform

## 🚀 Quick Start

To run the working tests:
```bash
npm run test:unit          # Run utility and service mock tests
npm run test:unit:coverage # Run with coverage report
npm run test:unit:watch    # Run in watch mode
```

## ✅ Working Tests (20/20 passing)

### 1. Phone Utilities (`src/utils/__tests__/phone.test.js`) - 11 tests
- **calculatePhonePrice**: Tests pricing algorithm for different models, conditions, and storage
- **validatePhoneData**: Tests form validation logic
- **formatPrice**: Tests USD and SOL price formatting

**Coverage: 100% statements, 94% branches, 100% functions, 100% lines**

### 2. Solana Services Mock (`src/services/__tests__/solana-mocks.test.js`) - 9 tests
- **Price Calculation Logic**: Tests SOL/USD conversion and condition multipliers
- **Order Status Flow**: Tests order lifecycle and ID generation
- **Phone Data Validation**: Tests required field validation
- **Shipping Label Generation**: Tests URL generation
- **Error Handling**: Tests invalid inputs and network errors

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### React Component Tests
- **Issue**: JSX transform conflicts with testing environment
- **Affected Files**: 
  - `src/components/__tests__/PhoneForm.test.jsx`
  - `src/pages/__tests__/HomePage.test.jsx`
- **Status**: Configuration needs adjustment for complex React components
- **Workaround**: Component logic is tested through utility functions

### Solana Dependencies
- **Issue**: ES modules and complex Solana dependencies cause test failures
- **Affected Files**: Direct imports of `@solana/web3.js` in tests
- **Status**: Using mock tests instead of integration tests
- **Workaround**: Service logic is tested through mock implementations

## 📊 Test Coverage Summary

| Component | Status | Coverage | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------|-------|
| Utils | ✅ Working | 100% | Full test coverage |
| Services (Mocked) | ✅ Working | Logic tested | Mock implementations |
| Components | ❌ Blocked | 0% | JSX transform issues |
| Integration | ❌ Blocked | 0% | Solana dependency issues |

## 🛠️ Test Configuration

### Working Configuration
- **Jest**: Configured with jsdom environment
- **Babel**: React JSX transform with automatic runtime
- **Coverage**: Threshold set to 80% (currently met for tested modules)

### Test Scripts Available
```bash
npm test                 # Run all tests (some may fail)
npm run test:unit        # Run only working tests
npm run test:coverage    # Full coverage report
npm run test:watch       # Watch mode for development
```

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Immediate (Working Now)
1. **Use `npm run test:unit`** for reliable testing during development
2. **Focus on utility and service logic testing** via mock implementations
3. **Achieve high coverage** for business logic and utility functions

### Short Term Fixes
1. **Fix JSX Transform**: Update Babel/Jest config for React component testing
2. **Mock Solana Dependencies**: Create comprehensive mocks for `@solana/web3.js`
3. **Add Integration Tests**: Test component interactions without full Solana stack

### Long Term Goals
1. **End-to-End Testing**: Add Cypress/Playwright for full user flow testing
2. **Solana Devnet Testing**: Test against actual Solana devnet
3. **Performance Testing**: Load testing for price calculation and order processing

## 🧪 Test Examples

### Running Working Tests
```bash
# Quick unit test run
npm run test:unit

# With coverage report
npm run test:unit:coverage

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:unit:watch
```

### Example Test Output
```
✓ Phone Utilities (11 tests)
  ✓ calculatePhonePrice (4 tests)
  ✓ validatePhoneData (3 tests) 
  ✓ formatPrice (4 tests)

✓ Solana Services (Mocked) (9 tests)
  ✓ Price Calculation Logic (2 tests)
  ✓ Order Status Flow (2 tests)
  ✓ Phone Data Validation (2 tests)
  ✓ Shipping Label Generation (1 test)
  ✓ Error Handling (2 tests)

Tests: 20 passed, 20 total
Coverage: 100% for utilities
```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

1. **Write utility functions** → Test with `npm run test:unit`
2. **Add business logic** → Create mock tests for complex dependencies
3. **Build components** → Test logic separately from UI rendering
4. **Integration testing** → Use browser preview and manual testing
