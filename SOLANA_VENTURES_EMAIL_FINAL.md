# Final Email Version with Minor Improvements

Subject: Instant Phone Trade-ins on Solana - Following up from X

Hey Anatoly and Josh,

Following up on Toly's suggestion to connect after our X conversation. 

**Problem:** Phone trade-ins are broken. Users wait weeks for evaluations, deal with disputed valuations, and often abandon the process entirely - leaving money on the table and creating purchase friction.

**ReFit makes trade-ins instant and trustless using Solana smart contracts:**

â€¢ Customer buys a new Seeker â†’ payment locks in smart contract
â€¢ They receive the new phone immediately  
â€¢ Using our mobile app, they photograph their old device (AI grades in <90 seconds)
â€¢ Ship the old phone back â†’ payment releases automatically upon confirmation

Every Seeker purchase could include instant trade-in credit, effectively turning old phones into down payments. This removes a major purchase barrier and differentiates Solana Mobile with seamless upgrade experiences.

**Traction:** Live at refit.trade, processing devices daily, 15 years industry experience (1M+ devices)

**The Opportunity:** Starting with phones but expanding to all physical goods - Solana becomes the infrastructure for circular commerce.

We're raising $3.5M to scale operations. Would love 15-30 minutes this week to show you a demo and discuss partnership opportunities.

Best,

P.S. - Happy to bring a Saga to demo the mobile app grading a phone live. Takes 90 seconds from photos to instant SOL payment.
