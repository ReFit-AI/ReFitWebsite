# ReFit Mobile Build Status

## üéØ Summary

The ReFit Mobile app has been successfully created with all the necessary components for Solana Mobile integration. However, the Android build is failing due to missing build tools on the current system.

## ‚úÖ What's Complete

1. **App Structure**
   - Full React Native TypeScript app created
   - All screens implemented (Home, Scan, Quote, Shipping)
   - Navigation structure set up

2. **Solana Integration**
   - Wallet connection logic (demo mode for testing)
   - Solana Web3.js integrated
   - Mock implementation for development

3. **Backend Integration**
   - API service configured
   - Connects to existing ReFit backend endpoints
   - Session management implemented

4. **UI/UX**
   - Dark theme matching ReFit brand
   - Solana colors (Purple #9945FF, Green #14F195)
   - Mobile-optimized layouts

## ‚ùå Build Issue

The Android build fails with:
```
[CXX1416] Could not find Ninja on PATH or in SDK CMake bin folders
```

This is because:
- CMake and Ninja build tools are not installed
- These are required by react-native-screens and react-native-gesture-handler
- Need admin privileges to install these tools

## üîß To Fix and Run

### Option 1: Install Missing Tools
```bash
# Install CMake and Ninja
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cmake ninja-build

# Or through Android Studio:
# SDK Manager ‚Üí SDK Tools ‚Üí CMake
```

### Option 2: Use Different Machine
1. Clone the repo on a machine with Android Studio fully configured
2. Run `npm install` in `/mobile/ReFitMobile`
3. Run `npm run android`

### Option 3: Build APK Directly
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
# APK will be in android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/
```

## üì± App Features When Running

1. **Home Screen**
   - ReFit branding
   - Connect wallet button (demo mode)
   - Feature list
   - Seed Vault badge

2. **Phone Scan**
   - Form for phone details
   - Will use camera in production

3. **Quote Screen**
   - Shows SOL and USD values
   - Real-time SOL price
   - Accept/Decline options

4. **Shipping**
   - Success confirmation
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - Complete trade-in flow

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Install required build tools (CMake, Ninja)
2. Run the app on emulator or device
3. Test the full flow
4. Add real Solana Mobile Wallet Adapter when running on Saga/Seeker
5. Implement camera scanning
6. Deploy to Solana Mobile Store

The app is ready and will run once the build tools are installed!
