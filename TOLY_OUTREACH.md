# Outreach to Toly - Seed Investment

## Message Draft (Direct & Concise)

**Subject:** ReFit update - orderbook system + seed round

---

Hey Toly,

Following up from when we first spoke about ReFit. We've made real progress and I wanted to share where we're at.

**What we've built:**
- Complete inventory management system (grading → tracking → margins)
- Full invoicing system with automated label generation via Shippo
- Processing real phones with working unit economics
- Built orderbook mockup (screenshot attached) showing the vision

**The Solana thesis is getting clearer:**
As we scale buyer/seller liquidity, we're moving toward a DEX-style orderbook for wholesale phone trading. Real-world assets meeting Solana's orderbook infrastructure - same UX traders know from Jupiter/Raydium, but for physical inventory.

**Where we're at:**
- Live inventory system with automated margin tracking
- Real transactions flowing through
- Clear path: inventory system → wholesale marketplace → orderbook system

**What's next:**
Looking to raise a small seed round ($100K) to:
- Cover 6-month runway ($9K/month ops)
- Working capital for inventory/arbitrage ($40K buffer)
- Scale from current volume to $500K+ annual run rate

Would love to have you lead it if you're still interested. Can show you the full system whenever works.

Let me know if this is something you'd want to be part of.

Best,
[Your name]

### ReFit - Wholesale Phone Trading on Solana

**Problem:**
Traditional wholesale phone market is opaque, inefficient, and requires significant capital with poor visibility into pricing and margins.

**Solution:**
Infrastructure layer for wholesale phone trading:
- Phase 1 (✅ Live): Inventory & invoicing system
- Phase 2 (6 months): Wholesale marketplace
- Phase 3 (12 months): DEX-style orderbook with real-time price discovery

**Current State:**
- Full inventory management system operational
- Automated invoicing with shipping integration
- Real margins being tracked per unit
- Foundation for marketplace built

**Unit Economics:**
- Average buy price: $800-900
- Average sell price: $1,000-1,100
- Gross margin: ~15-20% per unit
- Target volume: 50-100 units/month in 6 months

**Why Solana:**
- Orderbook infrastructure (proven with Jupiter, Raydium)
- Low fees for high-volume, low-margin trades
- Fast settlement for RWA transactions
- Native DeFi primitives for future escrow/settlement

**Funding:**
- Raising: $100K seed
- Use: $54K runway (6 months) + $40K working capital + $6K buffer
- Milestones:
  - 50 units/month flowing (3 months)
  - $500K annual run rate (6 months)
  - Marketplace MVP with 10+ buyers (6 months)

**Ask:**
$100K for 8-10% equity (or SAFE note with 1.5x cap)

## Follow-up Strategy

**If he responds positively:**
1. Schedule 30-min call to walk through system
2. Share access to live platform (admin demo)
3. Send simple term sheet
4. Close within 2 weeks

**If he's interested but wants to see more:**
1. Share monthly metrics for next 60 days
2. Show him orderbook system as it develops
3. Re-engage when we hit 25 units/month

**If he passes:**
1. Ask if he knows anyone in Solana ecosystem who might be interested
2. Ask for intro to Solana Foundation for grants
3. Move to community pool plan

## Notes

- Keep message short and visual (screenshots speak louder)
- Emphasize the Solana orderbook angle (that's what will excite him)
- Don't oversell - just show what's built and where it's going
- If he's in, move fast. If he's out, have backup plan ready.

**Best time to send:**
After you've tested the full system and have at least 5-10 successful transactions in the database to show real usage.
