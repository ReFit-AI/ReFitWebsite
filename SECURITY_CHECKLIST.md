# ReFit Security Checklist - Production Deployment

## ‚úÖ Completed Security Fixes

### üîê Authentication & Sessions
- [x] **Mobile sessions table created** - Added proper schema with indexes and RLS
- [x] **Session token hashing fixed** - Tokens are hashed before storage and comparison
- [x] **Distributed nonce storage** - Migrated from in-memory Map() to Redis/Upstash
- [x] **JWT utilities added** - Secure token generation and verification implemented

### üõ°Ô∏è Database Security
- [x] **RLS policies fixed** - Removed permissive "allow all" policies, implemented wallet-based access control
- [x] **Session expiry handling** - Automatic cleanup of expired sessions
- [x] **Proper indexes** - Added for performance and security queries

### üîí API Security
- [x] **Rate limiting implemented** - Using Upstash Redis with fallback
- [x] **CORS tightened** - Dynamic origin validation, removed wildcard in production
- [x] **Webhook signature verification** - Shippo webhook validation implemented
- [x] **Environment validation** - Required secrets are validated on startup

### üìù Logging & Privacy
- [x] **Sensitive logs removed** - Console logs wrapped in NODE_ENV checks
- [x] **PII redaction** - Helper functions to mask sensitive data
- [x] **Error sanitization** - Stack traces hidden in production

## üöÄ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Environment Variables
- [ ] Set strong `JWT_SECRET` (minimum 32 characters)
- [ ] Configure `SHIPPO_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- [ ] Set up `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`
- [ ] Verify all Supabase keys are production keys
- [ ] Ensure `NODE_ENV=production`

### Database
- [ ] Run migration: `002_mobile_sessions.sql`
- [ ] Run migration: `003_fix_rls_policies.sql`
- [ ] Verify RLS is enabled on all tables
- [ ] Test database backups are configured

### Infrastructure
- [ ] HTTPS enforced on all domains
- [ ] SSL certificates valid and auto-renewing
- [ ] CDN configured for static assets
- [ ] DDoS protection enabled (Cloudflare/similar)

### Monitoring
- [ ] Error tracking configured (Sentry/similar)
- [ ] Uptime monitoring active
- [ ] Security alerts configured
- [ ] Log aggregation set up

### Testing
- [ ] Authentication flow tested end-to-end
- [ ] Rate limiting verified working
- [ ] CORS tested from allowed origins
- [ ] Mobile app authentication tested

## üî¥ Critical Security Notes

### Payment Integration (When Implemented)
- **DO NOT** store private keys in code
- Use hardware wallet or KMS for treasury keys
- Implement transaction limits
- Add admin approval for large payments
- Monitor for suspicious activity

### Admin Access
- Implement separate admin authentication
- Use multi-factor authentication
- Audit log all admin actions
- Restrict admin API endpoints

### Data Protection
- Customer PII is encrypted at rest (Supabase handles this)
- Sessions expire after 24 hours
- Nonces are single-use and expire after 5 minutes
- No sensitive data in URLs or logs

## üìä Security Configuration Summary

| Component | Development | Production |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| **Session Storage** | Redis/In-memory | Redis (Upstash) |
| **Nonce Storage** | Redis/In-memory | Redis (Upstash) |
| **CORS Origins** | localhost:* | shoprefit.com only |
| **Console Logs** | Enabled | Disabled |
| **RLS Policies** | Wallet-based | Wallet-based |
| **Rate Limiting** | 20 req/10s | 20 req/10s |
| **Session Duration** | 24 hours | 24 hours |
| **Nonce Expiry** | 5 minutes | 5 minutes |

## üö® Emergency Response

### If Compromised:
1. Rotate all API keys immediately
2. Invalidate all active sessions
3. Reset JWT_SECRET
4. Review audit logs
5. Check for unauthorized database access
6. Notify affected users if PII exposed

### Key Rotation Schedule:
- JWT_SECRET: Every 90 days
- API Keys: Every 180 days
- Database passwords: Every 90 days
- Admin credentials: Every 30 days

## üìù Compliance Notes

### Data Retention:
- Orders: Indefinite (business records)
- Sessions: 30 days after expiry
- Logs: 90 days
- Customer data: As per privacy policy

### Required Disclosures:
- Privacy policy must mention crypto payments
- Terms must include wallet connection risks
- Cookie policy for session management
- Data processing agreement for shipping
