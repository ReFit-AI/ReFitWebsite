Subject: Instant Phone Trade-ins on Solana - Following up from X

## Final Version:

Hi Anatoly and Josh,

Thanks for the intro! I'm building ReFit, a Solana-native platform that's reimagining how we buy, sell, and recycle consumer electronics - starting with smartphones.

## What We've Built

**Live now at [refit.trade](https://refit.trade):**
- AI-powered device grading using computer vision (6-photo capture → instant valuation)
- Smart contract escrow for trustless buyback transactions
- Direct SOL payments to users' wallets
- Mobile app with Solana wallet integration

**The Innovation:** Smart Contract Phone Purchases
1. User buys new Seeker/Saga phone → funds held in escrow contract
2. Phone arrives with ReFit pre-installed → they photograph old device
3. AI grades instantly → they ship it → contract releases the difference
4. Old phones fund new ones, creating a sustainable circular economy

## Why This Matters

- **For Solana Mobile:** Native trade-in program that could significantly reduce barrier to Saga/Seeker adoption
- **For the Ecosystem:** First real-world commerce use case combining AI + smart contracts
- **For Scale:** Expanding from buyback → repair → wholesale → tokenized inventory → on-chain orderbooks for all hardware

## Technical Highlights

- Anchor-based smart contracts with PDA-managed escrow
- React Native app ready for Saga dApp store
- AI grading system with 95%+ accuracy (patent pending)
- Production architecture handling 50K+ assessments/day

## The Ask

1. **Partnership with Solana Mobile** - Official trade-in integration for Saga/Seeker
2. **VC Introductions** - Raising $2M to scale operations and liquidity
3. **SF Developer Support** - Optimizing our smart contracts for high throughput
4. **Inventory Access** - Would love to buy any old Sagas you have lying around!

## My Background

- 15 years running phone repair/wholesale businesses (processed 1M+ devices)
- Previously scaled wholesale operations to $50M+ annually
- Now bringing that expertise on-chain with Solana

I'm in the Bay Area and would love to show you a live demo. The mobile app can assess any phone in under 90 seconds, with instant SOL payment on acceptance.

What excites me most: this isn't just about phones. It's about creating the infrastructure for circular commerce on Solana - where any physical good can be bought, sold, repaired, and recycled through smart contracts.

Would love to explore how we can work together to make Solana the default blockchain for real-world commerce.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - The GitHub repo is at github.com/jbrace02/ReFit if you want to check out the code. We just shipped our AI grading system yesterday!
